# Genome_analysis_Unit_2
Material for Unit 2 of BIOL 3411: Principles and Methods of Genome Analysis at Northeastern University.

## Deliverable 2A
Work through through the material for ["Week 4 - What is a genomic variant?"](https://baylab.github.io/MarineGenomicsSemester/week-4--what-is-a-genetic-variant.html) , part of a course designed by Serena Caplins and Patrick Krug. Follow the instructions on the Deliverables 2A document, which has modifications specific to the Discovery Cluster. This exercise is an introduction to the various steps involves in analyzing NGS sequencing reads.

## Deliverable 2B
Complete the bowtie tutorial ["Lambda phage example"](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#getting-started-with-bowtie-2-lambda-phage-example), documenting your progress with screenshots or saved terminal sessions.

## Deliverable 2C
Complete In_class_prep_Feb14. This exercise strengthens your skills in working with sequencing reads and prepares you to work with real data.

## Deliverable 2D
Perform the steps applied when analyzing the Marine Genomics data to the real data from the Day lab (further instructions to follow).
